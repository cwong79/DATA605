(2) Given an mxn matrix where m > n, what can be the maximum rank? The mini-
mum rank, assuming that the matrix is non-zero?

For a rectangular m Ã— n matrix, the largest possible rank is the smaller of the two dimensions. In the case where m >
 n, the largest possible rank is n.

A non-zero matrix has a minimum of one entry, meaning it has a minimum of one pivot. As the rank is equivalent to the number of pivots, the minimum possible rank is 1.

(3) What is the rank of matrix B?

2. Problem set 2
Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A. You'll need to show your
work. You'll need to write out the characteristic polynomial and show your solution.
