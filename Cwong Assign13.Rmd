2) Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria. The level of contamination is changing at a rate of
bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where t is the number of days since treatment began. Find a
function N( t ) to estimate the level of contamination if the level after 1 day was 6530 bacteria per cubic centimeter.

3) Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the 3. equation of the line is f ( x ) = 2x - 9.

```{r}
((8.5)*(8.5)-(9*8.5))-((4.5)*(4.5)-(9*4.5))
```


4) Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations.
y = x^2 - 2x - 2, y = x + 2

```{r}
x1 = c(-5:5)
y1 = x1^2 - 2*x1 - 2
x2 = c(-5:5)
y2 = x2 + 2
plot(x1, y1, type="l", xlab="x1,x2", ylab="y1, y2")
lines(x2, y2, type="l")
```


5) A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year. It costs $3.75 to store one flat iron for one year. There is a fixed cost of $8.25 for each order. Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.

Solution -

x - number of orders/year
y - lot size per order

Based on the formula, x*y >= 110, x needs to be >= 1 

Cost of inventory per year = 3.75 (yx - 110) + 8.75x = 3.75yx + 8.75*x - 412.5

To keep our cost of inventory per year at the minimum, we need to minimize x and maximize y. From the cost function above, the mimumum value for x is 1 and since y = 110/x, y = 110.

By substitution, minimum cost is -

```{r}
C = 3.75 * ((110)*(1) - 110) + 8.75*(1)
C
```
