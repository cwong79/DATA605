1. Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be n mutually independent random variables, each of which is uniformly distributed on the integers from 1 to k. Let Y denote the minimum of the Xi’s. Find the distribution of Y.

2. Your organization owns a copier (future lawyers, etc.) or MRI (future doctors). This machine has a manufacturer’s expected lifetime of 10 years. This means that we expect one failure every ten years. (Include the probability statements and R Code for each part.).

a. What is the probability that the machine will fail after 8 years?. Provide also the expected value and standard deviation. Model as a geometric. (Hint: the probability is equivalent to not failing during the first 8 years..)

Using this formula for geometric, f(x) = P(X=x) = (1−p)^x−1 * p

The probability that the machine will fail after 8 years can be calculated using pgeom function. Expected value is 1/p. And, to calculate SD we can use √(1−p)/p2
```{r}
a <- pgeom(8, 0.1, lower.tail = F)
a

a_expected <- 1/(1/10)
a_expected

a_sd <- sqrt(9/10/((1/10)^2))
a_sd
```

b. What is the probability that the machine will fail after 8 years?. Provide also the expected value and standard deviation. Model as an exponential.

Failure after 8 years: 1 - P(X <= 8).
```{r}
b <- 1 - pexp(8,0.1)
b

b_expected <- 1/(1/10)
b_expected

b_sd <- sqrt((1/10)^-2)
b_sd
```


c. What is the probability that the machine will fail after 8 years?. Provide also the expected value and standard deviation. Model as a binomial. (Hint: 0 success in 8 years)

X ~ B(8, 0.1) P(X = 0), to calculate standard deviation we can use √np∗(1−p)
```{r}
c = dbinom(0, 8, 0.1) 
c

c_expected <- 8 * 0.1
c_expected

c_sd <- sqrt((8 * 0.1) * (1 - 0.1))
c_sd
```

d. What is the probability that the machine will fail after 8 years?. Provide also the expected value and standard deviation. Model as a Poisson.

X ~ P(0.8), following Poisson distribution mean is 0.8 and standard deviation is square root of mean.
```{r}
d = ppois(0,0.8)
d

d_expected <- 0.8
d_expected

d_sd <- sqrt(0.8)
d_sd
```
