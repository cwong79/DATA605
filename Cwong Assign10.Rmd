Smith is in jail and has 1 dollar; he can get out on bail if he has 8 dollars.
A guard agrees to make a series of bets with him. If Smith bets A dollars,
he wins A dollars with probability .4 and loses A dollars with probability .6.
Find the probability that he wins 8 dollars before losing all of his money if

(a) he bets 1 dollar each time (timid strategy).

Using first-step analysis, we have
φ(i) = 0.4φ(i+1) + 0.6φ(i−1), i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 
φ(0) = 0
φ(8) = 1

We solve and find the following:
```{r}
p <- 0.4
q <- 0.6
r <- q/p

for (i in 0:8){
p <- round((1-r^i)/(1-r^8),4)
print(paste(i," P:", p))
}
```

(b) he bets, each time, as much as possible but not more than necessary to
bring his fortune up to 8 dollars (bold strategy).

φ(3) = 0.4φ(6) = 0.256
φ(4) = 0.4φ(8) = 0.4
φ(6) = 0.4φ(8) + 0.6φ(4) = 0.64

(c) Which strategy gives Smith the better chance of getting out of jail?

When comparing the probabilities of both strategies, the bold strategy gives Smith the better chance of getting out of jail.
